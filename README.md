# Fake-YouTube

### [Fake-YouTube](https://henryjacobs.us) is a React YouTube clone that grants users much of the same functionality they would get on actual YouTube. 

Some of the things users can do on Fake-YouTube include :
- Uploading videos to their own channel
- Subscribing to other Fake-YouTube channels
- Watching user-uploaded content
- Interacting with user-uploaded content through likes and dislikes
- Commenting on User-Uploaded Content
- Customizing their channel's homepage.
- And many others! 

### How the site Functions

Fake-YouTube runs off of a free Firebase account that is limited to 30gb of video bandwidth a month. Firebase doesn't 
offer adaptive BitRate Streaming, so videos are expnesive to serve and the traffic to Fake-YouTube must be limited to 
a small number of users a month. As of right now, Fake-YouTube only utilizes Firebase Storage and Cloud Firestore to serve 
data, while the rest of processing required by Fake-YouTube happens in the browser. This means that all recommendation algorithms, 
sorting/searching routines, etc. are fairly straightforward. At some point in time, I intend to add more complexity through a 
dedicated backend or a serverless solution through something such as Firebase Functions. 

### Technologies Used
